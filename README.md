# Deep Merge

Deep merge is a very useful function for merging two different maps.  Most importantly, it handles arbitrarily deep maps of maps, meaning it's very useful for combining results.

There is a basic implementation of merge in `src/deepmerge.js`, but it doesn't fulfill the deep part of it.  Try updating the implmentation there so that the function merges deeply also!  If you'd like to, you can add more test cases in `test/deepmerge.js` to make sure it's behaving as expected.  Good luck!

# Setup
